Tetiana Ivanova - How to become a Data Scientist in 6 months a hacker's approach to career planning

Things not to do if you want a radical career change:
1. Hope that a masters degree is a ticket to a rosy future
2. Expect to do it all on your own
3. Not allow for margin of error
4. Don't burn your bridges
- Come back into your old industry should your plan fail
5. Hope that employer can read your mind
- while interviewing

What to do in the end?
1. Set a realistic time frame.
2. Dont trust yourself with sticking to deadlines
3. Make a study plan
4. Prepare for uncertainty

Study group for a statistics text book (ESLR)
Create costs for missing deadlines
Scope the area of study (latest developments, when did it all start and how long it will take to pick all the things up)
You don't know that you'll be able to learn things up in the stipulated amount of time
**stuck installing tensorflow/keras :P**

Time discounting and will power
- Will power is a limited resource
- External reinforcement and social cost of default
**Social cost of default**
when lenders tend to lend to the same person
default rates really high because no accountability
when lenders started tending to groups of people 
the default rates dropped to 2%
if one person defaults the other 5 have to pay the debt(humiliation by peers)
- Limit your choices
* If you plan to transition into another industry you have to manage your mood and choices
* Commit to it and do it for as far as you can until you fail beyond a reasonable point

Time management techniques
- Pomodoro (20 and then stretch for 5 minutes, you can't overwork)
- Spaced repetion(dont try to do 10 hour chunks at one time)
- Value of sleep(when sleep deprived you suffer, your concentration , will power and working memory suffers)
- Every little counts, Even 5 minutes
** for example applying to companies or formatting resumes or doing chores(in short things that you hate)
** reduce your pomodoro time to 5 minutes instead of 20 minutes 
** this way you have to stay focussed for a far less amount of time on these mundane tasks 
** but at the same time you get them done
- Kill your perfectionism
* Your not going to be perfect
* Dont expect to be an expert or humiliate others
* this is more about humility
* perfectionism doesn't let you get started

Networking
- somehow find connections
- it's easier to find a job from connections than by applications
- make friends

Networking for nerds
- understand you are in a group
- Signal belonging
- positive reinforcement
- this is still work!
- Don't expect immediate results
'Pester the **presenter**

Sign up for meetups and go to all of them

How to build a **boosted** tree

People will assume that you belong if they see you somewhere far too many times

The whole point of the excercise is not to be liked but to be able to find someone you like and get to know them even better

Try to pick out the ones that sound good to you

Anything that humiliates you in public is a good practise and it helps you gain some thick skin (for example a dance class or a improv class)

Resources for Data Science transition:
1. Meetups! PyData, LMLP, Data Science journal Reading club etc. Or start one yourself
2. Kaggle and hackathons
3. Coursera
4. Know your stats. "Elements of statistical learning", "An introduction to Statistical Learning with applications in R", Jaynes
5. Pester people
6. Read white papers. And blogs, deep mind ,karpathy, Google it
7. Textbooks are a reference, competitions are where the actual learning happens

Don't Get started
1. complex projects require extended planning
2. You need the right questions

Questions:
1. how should people in industry design interview questions for data scientists?
